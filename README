pg_log_userqueries is a PostgreSQL module that logs each query executed by a
superuser. It records each query in the standard log file.

There are also two more optional parameters that allow you to log all queries
per database and/or per user.

* pg_log_userqueries.log_db: to give a pipe separated list of database to log.
* pg_log_userqueries.log_user: to give a pipe separated list of user to log.

You can use advanced regular expression in that list. For example:

* pg_log_userqueries.log_usr="postgres|admin_.*|.*_adm"

will match if the exact username is 'postgres' or it begins by 'admin_' or ending by '_adm'.
