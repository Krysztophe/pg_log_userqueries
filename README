pg_log_userqueries is a PostgreSQL module that logs each query executed by a
superuser. It records each query in the standard log file.

There are also three more optional parameters that allow you to log all queries
per database and/or per user and/or per IP address.

* pg_log_userqueries.log_db: to give a pipe separated list of database to log.
* pg_log_userqueries.log_user: to give a pipe separated list of user to log.
* pg_log_userqueries.log_addr: to give a pipe separated list of address to log.

You can use advanced regular expression in that list. For example:

    pg_log_userqueries.log_user="postgres|admin_.*|.*_adm"

will match if the exact username is 'postgres' or if it begins with 'admin_' or
if it ends with '_adm'.

By default pg_log_userqueries will write queries to PostgreSQL log destination.
As a superuser can change this behavior, you can force pg_log_userqueries to log
independently into syslog by setting a syslog facility.

    pg_log_userqueries.syslog_facility='local0'

This will enable syslog output by selecting a level of log. It takes the same options than
PostgreSQL syslog_facility configuration directive.

You can also modify the syslog program ident string with configuration directive:

        pg_log_userqueries.syslog_ident='pg_log_userqueries'

Select syslog program identity name.
